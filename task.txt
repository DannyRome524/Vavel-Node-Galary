need run elastic search
Okay?

yes

now T1 is edit tasks/es-reindex.js file

to fix the script and can index from mongo to elastgic search index

(in version 6.8.3 it works but in 7.8 no) illegal mapping in a field

you mean 7.6? yes, sorry 7.6

curl localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v with this command you can see elastic indexes and numbers of docs

ty without '


seems a field in users collection is not compatible with elastic 7 and need fix, the type of some fields is what no allow index

Do you think it will be done by only editing es-reindex.js file? open it,

if i am right, are 2 or 3 indexes thatin this file have type:keyword or something like this
each index has a file, check in log what index fail
